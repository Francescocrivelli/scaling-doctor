# Find My Bun

Find My Bun is a platform that supercharges student careers using AI voice agents, serving as a personal career assistant rather than a traditional job board. Our AI agent has natural conversations with students to learn about their skills, experiences, and aspirations, then builds their profile without requiring manual resume creation or form-filling. This streamlined process saves students countless hours of job hunting by matching them with opportunities suited to their unique backgrounds.

For tech startups and companies, Find My Bun provides a curated talent pipeline of pre-vetted candidates with the specific skills they need. Students benefit from direct connections to relevant opportunities at early-stage companies before roles are even posted, while companies can efficiently discover qualified candidates. Our selective community ensures high-quality matches and creates meaningful connections between talented students and innovative tech organizations.
